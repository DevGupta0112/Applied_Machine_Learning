<h1 align="center">Applied_Machine_Learning</h1>

A growing collection of hands-on machine learning projects focused on solving real-world problems using Python and scikit-learn. This repository is part of my self-driven journey through the **"Learn by Building" ML series**, where I apply key concepts through practical implementation.

## 🎯 Goals

- Apply core ML concepts through real-world projects
- Build an end-to-end ML portfolio for interviews
- Strengthen data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation skills
- Learn by building — not just theory
